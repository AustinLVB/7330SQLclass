The FINAL SUBMISSION folder contains the final version of the assets to be turned in and graded.

Follow the directions in the WHDB.sql file to build the temp and final 2 databases, Employee and SalaryTable.
You will need to edit the location of the source file, WHData1CSV.csv, to wherever you have the file on your hard disk.
