#This project is for SMU class 7330 - Project 2.
#By Laura Bishop and Matt Przybyla
#
#The data is White House Salary from 2010, which was included in a report to Congress.
#Our goal is to pull yet to be determined insights about the salary levels and positions from this clean data.
#The raw data, imported into MySQL, is in .CSV format with header row deleted and Salary column changed from 'currency' 
#to 'general number' type with precision of 2 decimal places.
#
#To import the raw data, make the 2 changes to the .CSV file and then run the Load command commented out in the 
#WHdataLoad.sql file.
